## üìñ The Problem

Finding suitable opportunities in the job market can be daunting for job seekers as they have to sift through large amounts of data to find suitable opportunities that match their target positions, salary expectation ranges and ideal working locations. Such difficulties are usually encountered by career advisor and human resources analyst as well. The key challenge is the complexity and time-consuming nature of processing and understanding large amounts of job market data, which can lead to missed opportunities and unsatisfactory career decisions.

## üí° The Solution

Our dashboard serves as a personalized job market navigator, offering insights based on job postings on Linkedin across the US in 2023. It provides job seekers, career advisor and human resources analyst with a clear and interactive overview of the job landscape, enabling them to have a basic mindset on the US job market based on salary range, job type, and regions for different positions.
