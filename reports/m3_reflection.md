# Milestone 3 Reflection

We have implemented all the components in our proposal, except making map click as filter. In Milestone 3, we make some changes to our dashboard, including:

## Major changes

-    Tweak layout

    -    Enlarge the spacing between charts so that elements are not blending into each other

    -    Style the titles to a larger font size

    -    Set background colors for the filter area

    -    Remove duplicated description

-    Set the default view of the map to include all the states on the map and reflected in the charts, so that there is an interesting landing page.

## Minor changes

-    Removed region in xaxis titles

-    Combined min/max into one range slider

-    Centered title on map

-    Map fill out more space

-    Keeped map color scale fixed for all states

-    Changed the color of bar charts and map to make them more consistent

## Inspiration from peers (Challenging)

We get some inspiration from group 1's dashboard, Tuberculosis Tracker, and add more functionality to our map.

Specifically, when we click on a state on the map, it will display the region it belongs to on the side of the map.

## Limitations 

The map can have more interactive functions with the bar chart below. For example, the map can be set as a filter to choose state based on clicking. And the default view is regions for all the bar charts, it would be better if after selecting states the bar charts could switch to compare states on the bars x-axis instead, so that there is a drill down functionality.
