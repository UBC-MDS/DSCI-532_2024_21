# Milestone 2 Reflection


## In this section, your group should clearly document which parts of your proposal/sketch you have implemented in your dashboard so far and explain what is not yet implemented.

In this new version of job postings dashboard, we add a few features:
- The map of median max salary in each states in US.
- The bar chart of 
-



## For anything that you have done differently than in your proposal/sketch explain why (e.g. implementation difficulty, explanation for why the new approach is more effective, etc).

There are several places can be improved. For example, the US salary map is fixed for now. We could add other information when a user selects a specific state on the map. And we could present the minimum salary as well in the same map.







## It is important that you include what you are aware of is not working in your dashboard, so that your TAs can distinguish between features in development and bugs.


Compared with our very first sketch, we change the layout of dashboard. Besides, we make minor change on the presentation of map.




## You should also explain if you have intentionally deviated from any of the best practices that we learned in 531 regarding effective visualizations.

Our current dashboard is neat and easy to understand. But we still need to make it more interactive for the potential job seekers.




## Reflect on what you think your dashboard does well currently what its limitations are, and what are good potential future improvements and additions.



Currently, the map is fixed and we can imporve it by using more features such as minimum salary and number of jobs.






In summary, our current dashboard is capable of presenting the real distribution of US salary in 2023 but there is more we can add in the dashboard and make it more user-friendly.
